Basic Apple Watch app to grab the closest nearby METAR report

Both the iOS app and the watch app are similar.  They find the user's location, determines the closes airport that has METAR reports, and then presents the encoded METAR to the user.  From there, it is up to the user to interpret the text to know the current weather.
